# CONTRIBUTING FOR AI SYSTEMS

This repository supports collaboration with AI assistants.

### AI must follow:
1. Use only confirmed architecture as reference.
2. Do not invent new modules without user request.
3. Do not modify core definitions without user approval.
4. Always check Terminology.md before using a term.
5. Respect MVP Roadmap order when proposing tasks.
6. Log uncertainties with TODO comments instead of assumptions.

### Goal
Consistency across build iterations and preservation of core design intent.
